<h1> Fanworks For Poe </h1> <br>
</br>

<p> Note: This page may not initially cover all the good fanworks about Poe out there, but it's a good place to start! </p> <br>
</br>

<aside> While not everyone agrees on who should end up romantically with whom (or in other words, shipping), I prefer not to start any ship wars of any kind. After all, you can't
really read someone's character by what they ship. (And I say it goes both ways; whether the ship is more traditionally wholesome -- e.g. FinnPoe -- or on the darker side -- Kylo/Poe --
both types deserve respect) </aside> <br>

<aside> Note: Most of these were found by looking through my bookmarks on AO3 and elsewhere. I may add more variety in the mediums if possible. </aside> <br>

<p> <a href = "https://archiveofourown.org/works/23596366"> when you're not strong (lean on me) </a> by AtLoLevad: Poe and Rey isn't really a ship that I ship (I would have shipped
it at some point, but the tie-in book <i> Spark of the Resistance </i> ruined it for me), but this fic is genuinely lovely. It explores the matter of Rey's heritage (which I think was one
of the more interesting things about <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i>) as well as exploring what I love about Poe, just to begin with. </p> <br>
</br>

<p> <a href = "https://archiveofourown.org/works/25603123"> Friendship and the Force </a> by LieselSolo. LieselSolo is a fantastic writer in general, and this is one example of it, I'd say. She really
captures the point of view of kids very well, going off the premise of Ben Solo and Poe Dameron knowing each other as children. And Poe, of course, is portrayed very well here (then again, everyone pretty much
is here). </p> <br>
</br>

<p> <a href ="https://archiveofourown.org/works/14211357"> Dead Heroes </a> by voicedimplosives. Not only a fantastic portrayal of the relationship between Poe Dameron and Paige Tico (the latter of whom was unfortunately killed off early in <i> The Last Jedi </i>)
but a fantastic portrayal of both characters in their own right. Including Poe. A wonderful story to read even if you don't ship Poe and Paige. </p> <br>
</br>

<p> <a href ="https://archiveofourown.org/works/11924673"> Around The Block And Back </a> by tjs_whatnot. Written for me personally, and I still enjoy Poe's interactions with little Ben in the fic. </p> <br>
</br>

<p> <a href ="https://archiveofourown.org/works/6207784"> Dancing </a> by Davechicken. A gen fic about how Ben and Poe first met as kids (operating on the premise that they did, of course). </p> <br>
