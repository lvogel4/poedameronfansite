<h1> Poe Dameron and the Parallels That Others Overlook </h1> <br>
</br>

<h3> Han Solo </h3> <br>
</br>

<p> In terms of the usual parallels, Poe is usually given certain parallels to say, Han Solo in the Original Trilogy. One could say that there are some parallels, such as Poe's
talent with piloting and his snarky sense of humor. In addition, there is a certain visual similarity in the jackets they wear, especially when Poe wears them in <i> The Force Awakens </i>
and <i> The Last Jedi. </i> (He seems to drop the jacket for <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i> for a look that many compared to Nathan Drake in <i> Uncharted </i> when production photos from <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i>
were released) </p>

<p> More subtly, there is the fact that the two of them have a surprising ability for forgiveness; despite Lando's betrayal of him in <i> Empire Strikes Back, </i> Han is willing to give Lando another chance when they next meet in <i> Return of the Jedi; </i>
it naturally helps that Lando did redeem himself by assisting Leia and the others, and Han no doubt knew that Lando had been coerced into betraying him and his crew by Vader threatening Lando's city. In <i> The Force Awakens </i> as well, Han is willing to forgive Kylo
even after Kylo stabs him, reaching up to caress Kylo's cheek in one of the most iconic parts of that heartwrenching scene (which really was a prelude to how much darker the Sequel Trilogy got later on, with the ending to <i> Rise of Skywalker </i> being, to the chagrin of many,
more bittersweet than anything). Poe has a similar ability for forgiveness, being able to at least understand people and give them a second chance even when they outright hurt him. For example, despite his last interaction with Leia including an argument where she slapped him
and humiliated him in front of the Resistance in <i> The Last Jedi </i> (which proved to be a controversial moment), Poe still shows open concern for her when she ends up in a coma. In terms of his overall belief in people, however... </p>

<h3> Luke Skywalker </h3> <br>
</br>

<p> Ironically, especially considering how Rey was meant to be the genderswapped counterpart of Luke in the Original Trilogy (with plenty of prequel Anakin sprinkled in in some ways), Poe actually shares more similarities with Luke. Both of them grew up relatively sheltered
(even Luke's worst complaint about Tatooine seemed to be it being outright boring as opposed to actively hazardous). Both of them had a parent who they wanted to emulate in terms of being a pilot (though Shara, obviously, was a much better parent to Poe than Vader was to Luke, and
Luke did also want to emulate his father being a former Jedi as well). Both of them had a sense of restlessness in regards to a difficult parental figure keeping secrets (Poe with Kes, Luke with Uncle Owen), and both fundamentally had a sense of idealism and hope in other people that
ultimately became one of their best traits. Luke in the Original Trilogy was all too willing to see the good in Vader despite the galaxy thinking otherwise; Poe was willing to extend that to just about everyone. He was willing to save Sela Trune's life in <i> Freefall </i> despite her
dislike of him (which mostly was a case of guilt-by-association), and tried to save her again after Zorii's mother, Zeva, fatally wounded her (even though he failed, and he was genuinely shaken by being unable to save her). He was willing to give Finn a chance despite just meeting him
in <i> The Force Awakens, </i> and also showing pity towards characters such as Oddy Muva (despite his traitor status, mostly due to Oddy being under pressure at the time). He was willing to show faith in Kazuda Xiono despite most people who knew Kaz seeing him as an active hindrance,
and even with General Hux (who not only destroyed the Hosnian system and terrorized the Resistance later on, but also, according to the novelization of <i> The Last Jedi </i>, was planning to torture Poe himself for the sake of one-upping Kylo), despite him having no issue humiliating Hux
in front of his own fleet in <i> The Last Jedi, </i> Poe had no problem accepting his help in <i> The Rise of Skywalker, </i> temporary as it was. It is a defining trait of Poe's that he doesn't really see the First Order as all monsters as much as people who need to be stopped (with a side of
him thinking there's parts of this that are a fun adventure) and just because evil is what they do doesn't necessarily mean that's who they are. </p>

<p> Notably, the only one who Poe does not show much mercy to is Kylo Ren, due to Kylo's torture of him on <i> The Finalizer, </i> but even then, he doesn't really want to get revenge on Kylo. At bare minimum (despite his reluctance to talk about Kylo Ren), he wants
Kylo Ren to face justice for his crimes via imprisonment. (Poe's reaction to Ben's redemption and later death still hasn't been elaborated on) </p> <br>
</br>

<h3> Leia Organa </h3> <br>
</br>

<p> Fittingly for Leia Organa's protege, Poe shares some parallels with her -- his opening scene is an homage in some ways to Leia managing to smuggle the Death Star plans into Artoo in <i> A New Hope, </i> and even his moment where he snarks back at Kylo Ren could
be seen as a parallel to Leia openly defying Vader to his face. The differences do come in the execution, though; Leia is more defiant and attempting to bluff -- badly at that -- to Vader when he confronts her in <i> A New Hope, </i> while Poe is more openly sarcastic. Vader
is calm and in control, while Kylo, arguably, has more of a personality that is a strange combination of "a deeply unpleasant man" and "oddly humorous in a bleak way at times". And Kylo has less control than Vader; him cutting down Lor San Tekka with a snappy one-liner after Tekka
brings up the matter of Kylo's heritage is one example. In addition, the way Vader handles Leia vs. how Kylo handles Poe has some differences; Vader is indifferent and impersonal towards Leia in their confrontation, with a subtle hint of snark when he says Leia wasn't on any mercy mission.
In contrast, while that goes out the window in the torture scene, Kylo initially seems to be pulling his punches with Poe in his capture -- he manages to freeze the blaster bolt that Poe shoots at him in his tracks, clearly reluctant to kill Poe even before knowing for certain Poe had valuable information.
(Of course, it is striking that Kylo mostly seems to be using defensive techniques against his enemies in <i> The Force Awakens, </i> giving the impression that he's attempting more to be pragmatic than anything else) He doesn't manhandle Poe personally or try to have him hurt; the stormtroopers do that on their own
(and, again, it should be mentioned that it's before Kylo learns Lor San Tekka gave Poe the map). Even his posture towards Poe during the capture scene is different from Vader's; while Vader stands tall if only to assert his position of power over Leia (as well as just in general), Kylo, oddly, only remains on his feet
briefly when Poe's brought before him (and, unnecessarily, forced to kneel; note that the stormtroopers did that, which is interesting), before (as described in the script) kneeling in front of Poe as if to get on his level better. Even the way he handles Poe is different; Vader's voice is harsh and authoritative
in dealing with Leia as she acts as a mixture of defiant and attempting to bluff him -- granted, she fails, but it's still worthy of admiration. In contrast, Kylo's usually harsh, thudding voice softens when he speaks with Poe (different than when he's giving the stormtroopers orders), and even his method of finding out the information
from Poe is different even from how he extracts the information from Rey: with Poe, he seems to be scanning Poe's mind painlessly (note that there's no sign of pain on Poe's face, no sign of being invaded) to the point Poe still has time to actively make fun of him. (And despite the fact that Poe is actively making fun of him,
Kylo does not try to punish him in any way -- especially striking given how when Snoke calls him a "child in a mask" in <i> The Last Jedi, </i> Kylo doesn't take it well) </p>

<p> Obviously, it doesn't make the whole sequence less unsettling, but it does raise questions (at least for me) as to why Kylo reacted as he did. Even before he knew Poe had the map for certain, he tried to take Poe in with mostly defensive techniques and making sure he wasn't seriously hurt. </p>

<p> Poe's interrogation scene is also an homage to the interrogation in <i> A New Hope, </i> and possibly the first interrogation scene to actually be shown onscreen (note that things such as Han's interrogation usually had a cutaway before anything grisly happened). In contrast to Leia's torture scene, Poe's torture scene
is more shown in a psychological light; one of the things that makes it unsettling is the idea that something is just very off about what is going on, accentuated by the eerie sound design as well as Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac's performances. It's also an inversion of Leia's torture scene; while Leia's torture involved resisting mental probing,
Poe's interrogation involved him succumbing to the mental probe (and it is notable that Poe isn't victim-blamed in any way for it in canon, even though it is not followed up again). There's even a small detail with Vader not giving Leia any compliments except when she's out of earshot, while Kylo is open to express to Poe how impressed he is that he initially
resisted the more physical parts of interrogation. (In a way, one can argue that it makes the scene even creepier) </p>
