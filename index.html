										<p>Poe Dameron is a character played by the actor Oscar Isaac, known also for roles such as in <i> Inside Llewyn Davis </i> and the recent
										Disney Plus show <i> Moon Knight. </i> It has been considered his big break overall for an acting career despite Oscar Isaac's dissatisfaction 
										ultimately with his character's arc. Poe is Leia's right hand man in the Resistance, who ultimately takes over for her after her untimely passing in <i> The Rise of Skywalker. </i></p>

										<p> While the Sequel Trilogy had its share of problems, for me, the characters were not one of them. Rey was important to me because of getting to see a female Jedi onscreen in a leading role,
										but Poe really meant a lot to me overall because of what he represented: the idea that kindness isn't weakness. The fact that he is still willing to show mercy even to people who don't like him (Sela Trune in <i> Poe Dameron: Freefall </i> is a good example) is
										miraculous in and of itself. Regardless of gender identity or race, you don't see characters like Poe in every franchise, in my opinion.</p>

										<p>No, but I do like their relationship; it is clear that whether you see it as platonic or romantic, Poe and Finn usually (with the exception of parts of <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i> on Kef Bir) bring out the best in each other. I ship Finn/Rey and Poe/Kylo (old ships from first viewing The Force Awakens are hard to get rid of), but
										I can see the appeal of Finn/Poe. I was initially okay with Poe/Zorii before certain developments in <i> Freefall </i> turned it into a toxic relationship. (No doubt part of the point, but still) </p>

								<h2> Blog Post: Poe's Childhood </h2>
								</header>
								<p> In terms of Poe’s childhood, there are things that are set in stone and made obvious, and some that are more ambiguous. There is a fan theory, for example, that Poe Dameron was childhood friends with Ben Solo (the future Kylo Ren), before Ben’s unfortunate fall to the Dark Side. There is evidence that does make it plausible, such as the fact that the Solos and the Damerons were family friends during the war against the Empire, as well as Poe managing to recognize Kylo without his mask on Crait. In addition, in one of Poe’s memories in the book Freefall, he manages to remember an anonymous boy playing with him in his childhood home, though we never get a description of said anonymous boy or even a name. It could be anyone, actually, but there is a likelihood that Ben is being alluded to. (Or even an entirely new character whose previous status was never referenced. Whether it’s Ben or not, no doubt Alex Segura, the author of Freefall, made an ambiguous reference to said boy’s identity for a reason, narrative or otherwise) Then again, it’s also mentioned in Freefall that Poe had quite a few friends as a child before his father isolated himself and his son after the devastation of Shara’s death. It is likely either way that he might have crossed paths with Ben at some point before the latter’s fall to the Dark Side. (Some have suggested that Poe knew who Kylo was under the mask all along and that was part of his flippant attitude with him)
								</p>
								<p> As for things about Poe’s childhood that are certain, it’s established that he was initially raised by his grandfather while his mother was fighting with the Rebellion in the war. Despite her more workaholic territories (as much as a soldier fighting against oppression can be), Shara Bey was a deeply caring mother to Poe once she came back into his life, teaching him to fly his first ship, for example, at the age of six years old. It’s made clear in Freefall that despite Poe’s emotional difficulties with Kes, which is a result of Kes developing unhealthy coping mechanisms after Shara’s death (one can only assume that Kes got extensive amounts of therapy after the events of Freefall after realizing his coping mechanisms were doing more harm than good), he has nothing but compliments for his late mother. Shara is consistently portrayed as a warm, caring woman with a great sense of humor who was a good role model for Poe. It is good, in my opinion, that she was kept this way even with the Spice Runner retcon regarding Poe’s backstory, especially considering that male characters idolizing their mothers isn’t usually portrayed in a positive or even at least normal light. (Let’s have more instances of mothers being good role models, shall we?) </p>

															<p>Colin Trevorrow's <i> Duel of the Fates </i> script that would have been the final Episode Nine if not for Colin Trevorrow being fired for unclear reasons is the most famous
															of the what-could-have-been scenario for The Rise of Skywalker (especially given the fans' disappointment with it, especially an ending that was more on the bitter side in bittersweet) but
															an old script actually would have taken the Poe-as-a-Spice-Runner angle further with him actually being raised by the Spice Runners themselves and them, in addition to the First Order, being on
															Poe's tail due to their anger at Poe deserting them for the Resistance. How Poe's canonical parents would have played into this -- Shara Bey and Kes Dameron, both in the Rebellion and friends of Han and Leia --
															was not specified. (Though I am glad that they didn't go with that plot. It makes for a good what-if scenario, but thank God it wasn't canon!)</p>

																<h3>Did you know?</h3>

															<img src="kyloandpoe.JPG" alt="The interrogation scene from TFA" width="200" height="200">
															<p>Director of <i> The Force Awakens </i> and <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i> casually dropped a reference to possibly shipping Poe and Kylo.
															When on an MTV interview promoting <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i> prior to its actual release, JJ actually did, amidst the majority of the cast members talking about how wonderful Finn/Poe was (it was choosing between Finn/Poe and Reylo)
															ask why no one was talking about Poe/Ren. (Note: "Ren" is how he refers to Kylo, which is ironic considering that in the <i> Rise of Kylo Ren </i> comic, there is a separate character simply called Ren who appears as Kylo's predecessor in leading the Knights of Ren)

															Interestingly, the MTV interviewer themselves was quite onboard with it and actually seemed to want to see scenes between them in TROS! (Sadly, that was not to be) </p>
