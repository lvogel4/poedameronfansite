											<h3>Okay, so who is he?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Poe Dameron is a character played by the actor Oscar Isaac, known also for roles such as in <i> Inside Llewyn Davis </i> and the recent
										Disney Plus show <i> Moon Knight. </i> It has been considered his big break overall for an acting career despite Oscar Isaac's dissatisfaction 
										ultimately with his character's arc. Poe is Leia's right hand man in the Resistance, who ultimately takes over for her after her untimely passing in <i> The Rise of Skywalker. </i></p>

											<h3>Why him, exactly?</h3>
										</header>
										<p> While the Sequel Trilogy had its share of problems, for me, the characters were not one of them. Rey was important to me because of getting to see a female Jedi onscreen in a leading role,
										but Poe really meant a lot to me overall because of what he represented: the idea that kindness isn't weakness. The fact that he is still willing to show mercy even to people who don't like him (Sela Trune in <i> Poe Dameron: Freefall </i> is a good example) is
										miraculous in and of itself. Regardless of gender identity or race, you don't see characters like Poe in every franchise, in my opinion.</p>

											<h3>Do you ship Poe/Finn (or Stormpilot, as it used to be called)?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>No, but I do like their relationship; it is clear that whether you see it as platonic or romantic, Poe and Finn usually (with the exception of parts of <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i> on Kef Bir) bring out the best in each other. I ship Finn/Rey and Poe/Kylo (old ships from first viewing The Force Awakens are hard to get rid of), but
										I can see the appeal of Finn/Poe. I was initially okay with Poe/Zorii before certain developments in <i> Freefall </i> turned it into a toxic relationship. (No doubt part of the point, but still) </p>

															<p>Colin Trevorrow's <i> Duel of the Fates </i> script that would have been the final Episode Nine if not for Colin Trevorrow being fired for unclear reasons is the most famous
															of the what-could-have-been scenario for The Rise of Skywalker (especially given the fans' disappointment with it, especially an ending that was more on the bitter side in bittersweet) but
															an old script actually would have taken the Poe-as-a-Spice-Runner angle further with him actually being raised by the Spice Runners themselves and them, in addition to the First Order, being on
															Poe's tail due to their anger at Poe deserting them for the Resistance. How Poe's canonical parents would have played into this -- Shara Bey and Kes Dameron, both in the Rebellion and friends of Han and Leia --
															was not specified. (Though I am glad that they didn't go with that plot. It makes for a good what-if scenario, but thank God it wasn't canon!)</p>

																<h3>Did you know?</h3>

															<img src="kyloandpoe.JPG" alt="The interrogation scene from TFA" width="200" height="200">
															<p>Director of <i> The Force Awakens </i> and <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i> casually dropped a reference to possibly shipping Poe and Kylo.
															When on an MTV interview promoting <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i> prior to its actual release, JJ actually did, amidst the majority of the cast members talking about how wonderful Finn/Poe was (it was choosing between Finn/Poe and Reylo)
															ask why no one was talking about Poe/Ren. (Note: "Ren" is how he refers to Kylo, which is ironic considering that in the <i> Rise of Kylo Ren </i> comic, there is a separate character simply called Ren who appears as Kylo's predecessor in leading the Knights of Ren)

															Interestingly, the MTV interviewer themselves was quite onboard with it and actually seemed to want to see scenes between them in TROS! (Sadly, that was not to be) </p>
