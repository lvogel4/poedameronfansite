<h1> About Poe Dameron </h1> <br>
</br>

<p> As someone who has written extensively about Poe Dameron (for character-focused reasons as well as shipping related reasons. But that's another story entirely), I definitely have
my own theories and ideas about him. </p>

<aside> Or, as people commonly call them in fandom at large, headcanons. While the word has been used in a derogatory context recently, usually to call out perceived fan entitlement, the
concept itself doesn't automatically mean fan entitlement. Sometimes it can be used to enhance the story and/or character, or it can be used in order to allow a sense of familiarity and even representation
with a certain fan with that character. </aside>

<p> In terms of Poe Dameron's history, it is perhaps the most developed of the new Sequel Trilogy protagonists' out there. The story begins, naturally, with two parents who were wondering how to provide for their young son. </p>

<h2> Early Life </h2> <br>
</br>

<p> While JJ Abrams was originally coming up with the idea of Poe being raised by the Spice Runners in the then-untitled Episode Nine and having to deal with the wrath of his family of origin while also helping out the Resistance
(in this case, there was no Palpatine involved and it all came down to a code that the Resistance needed to decipher in order to stop the First Order), Poe was originally born to two Rebel fighters.
His father, Kes Dameron, was part of the Pathfinders with Han Solo (whose own career needs no introduction), while Poe's mother, Shara Bey, was a skilled pilot who protected Leia Organa (whose career also
needs no introduction) in the Battle of Naboo that was part of Operation Cinder (or, in short terms, Palpatine throwing a galactic-wide temper tantrum. That plotline, obviously, was conceived before the last minute
addition of Palpatine himself in <i> The Rise of Skywalker. </i>). Kes Dameron and Shara Bey were, obviously, very closely tied to the Solo family, with Chewbacca himself even apparently saving Kes Dameron's life. </p>

<p> If Poe Dameron ever crossed paths at any point with Ben Solo, later Kylo Ren, it's ultimately unknown; there are allusions in <i> The Last Jedi </i> that it is possible, especially in the novelization; Poe manages to,
in the novelization, not only recognize Kylo Ren without his mask and armor on Crait but also remember that he was Luke Skywalker's nephew. It is also mentioned in the <i> The Last Jedi </i> novelization that Leia was watching
over Poe from a young age, and in the tie-in book <i> Poe Dameron's Flight Log, </i> it is established that Leia thought highly of Shara Bey, as revealed in something she wrote about Shara after the latter's untimely death. (Shara's
cause of death has ultimately not been specified, though details from <i> Poe Dameron: Freefall </i> make it likely that she was killed on the job of Yavin's defense force. That being said, nothing has been officially confirmed or elaborated on) </p>

<p> Poe was raised by his grandfather for the first couple years of his life, or Shara's father; it was especially notable considering that Shara Bey was heavily devoted to the fight; it took paperwork interference from her friend Lu'lo Lampar
(who later became a favorite uncle of Poe's, and the only friend that Kes Dameron kept in touch with after grief over Shara Bey's death ultimately led him to isolate himself, and ultimately caused problems for Poe himself including a rift between him and his father)
for her to settle down and raise her son with Kes. That being said, it should be noted that Shara was an overwhelmingly loving mother towards Poe and Poe, after her untimely death, had nothing but compliments regarding her. She had a certain
idealism to her, believing that the galaxy was a fundamentally good place (a mentality that helped Poe recover from his traumatizing interrogation on the Finalizer). She had a certain element of compassion, wanting nothing more than to join the Rebellion not
for glory, but for the sake of protecting others -- a trait she no doubt passed onto her son later in life when he joined the Resistance. As a mother, she taught Poe how to fly his first ship at the age of six; it's noted in <i> Poe Dameron: Freefall </i> that
Poe still has good memories of "piloting" that ship with his mother. </p>

<p> It's made very obvious from this point forward that Poe's mother was his greatest influence -- there are subtle parallels in how he treats others (his belief that the galaxy is a good place, his fundamental desire to help people that borders on messianic at times),
but there is also the fact that she was the main inspiration for him becoming a pilot. The main conflict of <i> Poe Dameron: Freefall </i> even mostly revolves around Poe wanting to be a pilot like his mother, despite his father's misgivings (caused in part by his grief over
Shara's death). </p>

<aside> It should be noted that despite some most likely believing Poe to be a bratty teenager, as he was sixteen when he first joined the Spice Runners, Kes does share some of the blame; it does go without saying that he isn't a terrible person or a terrible father though.
It's made clear in <i> Freefall </i> that most of his behavior is a result of maladaptive coping mechanisms while grieving for Shara, to the point of not even allowing his son to mention her name or ask questions about her as well as isolating himself. It no doubt
goes without saying that <i> Freefall </i> could have been averted if Kes Dameron had gone to therapy. (Unfortunately, therapy doesn't seem to exist in the Star Wars universe) </aside>

<h2> Later Development </h2> <br>
</br>

<p> In a way, Poe's later development is contradicted by multiple sources; the initial source materials written before <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i> said that he had initially joined the Republic Navy before becoming fed up with their inaction regarding the First Order
and joining the Resistance -- hence where he met Leia for the first time. (See also <i> Before the Awakening. </i>) It was only after <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i> came out that the Spice Runner backstory was included, and even then, <i> Freefall </i> does contradict Zorii Bliss' 
story significantly in at least one part; namely, that he defected from the Spice Runners before the war with the First Order broke out. (Contrast that with <i> Freefall, </i> where Poe clearly joined Leia far before the First Order became a really tangible threat) </p>

<p> It is ironic, in a way, that for a character who arguably got the most development and backstory of the main protagonists, Poe Dameron's backstory also has the most contradictions. What hasn't been changed is him joining the Resistance, starting his own squadron, and coming across his fair
share of colorful characters before his encounter on Jakku with Kylo Ren. The comics do a good job, IMHO, of establishing that he's compassionate fundamentally despite his way of dealing with events with snarky humor. In addition, the 2018 cartoon <i> Star Wars: Resistance </i> established him as becoming
a mentor figure of sorts to Kazuda Xiono during the latter joining the Resistance. </p>

<p> Most of his history is pretty well-known in popular culture: his encounter on Jakku with Kylo Ren and surviving the interrogation where the map was being sought, as well as him befriending Finn, and his brief moment of good-intentions-gone-astray in <i> The Last Jedi </i> (it has been a point of debate as to whether
or not he was unfairly demonized for it, as well as if he was held to higher standards than the white characters), as well as him ultimately taking a leadership role in <i> The Rise of Skywalker </i> due to Leia's untimely death (note: this was done in order to deal with the real life issue of Carrie Fisher's passing, as well as
the fact that the most the filmmakers had to give a sense of proper closure was old stock footage they repurposed for the sake of Leia's new scenes in <i> The Rise of Skywalker. </i>). The LEGO specials also elaborate on his adventures afterwards, such as his encounter with Darth Vader's old creepy helper Vanee in <i> Terrifying Tales, </i>
though the question of the LEGO specials' canonicity is still up for grabs. </p> <br>
